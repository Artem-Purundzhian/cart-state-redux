# Redux Shopping Cart

This project is a small pet project developed to showcase my skills in Redux state management and React. It demonstrates the implementation of a shopping cart using Redux, where users can browse products, add them to the cart, and manage quantities. The project emphasizes the use of Redux principles such as actions, reducers, action creator thunks and store to efficiently manage application state.

## Features

- **Shopping Cart:** Add products to the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
- **Redux State Management:** Utilize Redux actions, reducers, action creator thunks and store to manage application state.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
